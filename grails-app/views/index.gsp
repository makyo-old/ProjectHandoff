      <p class="illuminated">Welcome to Project Handoff!  If you've ever had more than one person
      working on a project, you know how difficult it can be to manage who has
      what files and what they're supposed to be doing with them.  That's where
      Project Handoff comes in; manage multiple files within a project amongst
      numerous actors, each with a role to play.</p>
